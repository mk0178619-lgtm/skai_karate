      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        SKAI_Kolathur branch was started in 2011 by Sensei K. Manikandan (4th
        Dan, KIO – National Judge) under the guidance of Shihan B. Duraivelu,
        with the mission of promoting Karate as a way of life. SKAI_Kolathur is
        a proud branch of the Shuhari Karate Association of India (SKAI Karate),
        founded by four directors – Shihan B. Duraivelu, Shihan G. Gajendran,
        Shihan N. Pandian, and Shihan B. Loganathan.

        Sensei K. Manikandan is the founder and guiding force of our dojo. With
        years of dedicated experience in Karate, he trains students in
        discipline, technique, and character, inspiring them to reach their full
        potential both on and off the mat.

        Our journey began humbly in Kolathur with just a few students, where
        each class was a step toward building discipline, skill, and confidence.
        Through passion, dedication, and a focus on quality training, the dojo
        steadily grew, and today we proudly operate 8 branches across Chennai
        and its surroundings.

      <h2>Our Training Style</h2>
      <p>
        We specialise in Seigokan Goju-Ryu Karate, a traditional Japanese style
        founded in 1945 by Seigo Tada Sensei and presently led by Grand Master
        Takeshi Fukuchi. Known for its unique balance of hard and soft
        techniques, Seigokan Goju-Ryu emphasizes powerful strikes, close-range
        defence, breathing control, and mental discipline. Training is rooted in
        Kihon (basics), Kata (forms), and Kumite (sparring), ensuring the
        holistic development of both body and mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to traditional training, TEAM SKAI_KOLATHUR also offers
        Sports Karate, Self-Defence, and Tournament Coaching, with our students
        consistently excelling at state and national-level competitions.

      <p>
        At SKAI_Kolathur, we believe Karate is more than just a martial art—it
        is a way of life that builds respect, resilience, and leadership. Our
        mission is to empower students of all ages to embrace discipline, stay
        healthy, and cultivate a strong character that extends beyond the dojo.
        With a blend of tradition and modern training methods, we continue to
        shape confident individuals who carry the true spirit of Karate into
        every aspect of their lives.
